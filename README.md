# Sponge

Sponge is a library for dealing with building SOAP requests and parsing
responses.

This is a work-in-progress. The WSDL parser is the current step of development.

## Goals

* No HTTP library. Sponge is not designed to actually make HTTP requests
* Loosely based on the [LolSoap Ruby library](https://github.com/loco2/lolsoap)
* No production dependencies outside standard library
